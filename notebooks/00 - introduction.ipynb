    "# Logging\n",
    "SQLAlchemy is pretty good with *what* it logs, but it has a quirk if you start logging after creating an engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is important because some queries will cause multiple executions (mainly in ORM queries).<br>\n",
    "These queries aren't shown when using `str(query)`.<br>\n",
    "This usually happens in a table join statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text `[generated in X.Ys]` refers to the time it took to generate a valid SQL string from code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text `[cached since XXs ago]` comes up in logging a lot.\n",
    "This refers to the cache for the QueryBuilder, in which the query is serialized to a valid SQL string.\n",
    "It does **NOT** refer to cached database results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*See also: [SQL Compilation Caching at docs.sqlalchemy.org](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sql-compilation-caching)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The logger here is outputting to 'Standard Output'.\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks don't relay messages in perfect real-time. That means that when a message is sent to `stdout` and `stderr` at nearly the same time, they might arrive out of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping both on `stdout` keeps clarity about what happens first.\n"
